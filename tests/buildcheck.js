// binary the addresses were found in, and warns when it is not.  The failure
// it exists to catch is silent, so it is worth knowing that the check itself

// Frida runs QuickJS and the agent shares one scope, so the harness is the
// host's own recipe: gen/addr.js first, then the module under test, evaluated
// as one script in a context holding fake Frida globals.  Only core is loaded;
// it is where the check lives and every other module would drag in stubs that
// prove nothing.  The fake process is built out of agent/signatures.json, so
// "the expected build" here is the same file the agent compares against.
