"""Injects the same agent with frida-python instead of the Rust host.

Isolates one question a game restart can otherwise not answer: is a crash caused
by the agent's hooks, or by the frida version the host links?  The host embeds
frida-core 17.9.5 (whatever the devkit shipped), while frida-python here is
whatever is installed, the same one the original research hooks ran under.

    python tests\inject_python.py [--only health] [--skip gold]

Answers every ASK with "no change", so the game behaves as if no mod were
loaded.  Anything the agent sends is printed.
