"""Where the address registry comes from.

The registry is its own repository, and this one has to build without it: a
lone `git clone` of coderpack is a normal thing to do. So the file is looked
for in the places a person would actually have it, and downloaded when they
have it nowhere.

Order, most specific first:

    1. a path on the command line
    2. $CODERPACK_MAPPINGS
    3. ../mappings, the sibling checkout, first because somebody editing the
       registry expects their edit to be the one that gets used
    4. the copy on GitHub, at the ref in .mappings-ref, cached under build/

Nothing here needs credentials: the mappings repository is public.
